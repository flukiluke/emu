Emu and FUNKEY: A programming duet.

FUNKEY is a stack-based language with an input method based on playing music into the microphone. It was written for a competition with a 100 line limit, hence the light code golfing. See funkey.txt for details.

Emu is a successor to FUNKEY; it takes the same basic language, extends it and uses a more traditional textual interface. Documentation for Emu is yet to be written.
